      There must be some kind of magic
      In the way that you capture my heart
      Oh, won't it be kind of tragic
      If we don't give it a start?
      It's a shot in the dark
      But you're always worth the risk
      You made me believe in love again
      Wish I could be more than just a friend
      Can you tell me, Moon?
      Do I have a chance with you?
      'Cause I believe enough that this could be something
      It's possible that we won't meet halfway
      If I do profess, would you stay?
      Will we return to how it is?
      Will honesty have no regrets?
      It's a shot in the dark
      But you're always worth the risk

      Do I have a chance with you?
      'Cause I believe enough that this could be something
      Believe in love again
      Could be something
      Love is surrendering
      Could be something
      Believe in love again
      Could be something
      Love is surrendering
      We could be something
