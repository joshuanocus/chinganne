      There must be some kind of magic
      In the way that you capture my heart
      Oh, won't it be kind of tragic
      If we don't give it a start?
      It's a shot in the dark
      But you're always worth the risk
      You made me believe in love again
      Wish I could be more than just a friend
      Can you tell me, Moon?
      Do I have a chance with you?
      'Cause I believe enough that this could be something
      It's possible that we won't meet halfway
      If I do profess, would you stay?
      Will we return to how it is?
      Will honesty have no regrets?
